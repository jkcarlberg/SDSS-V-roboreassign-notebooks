# SDSS-V-roboreassign-notebooks
This respository will contain Jupyter notebooks to aid in the analysis of roboreassign outputs.

The user will first have to download a copy of the outputs from https://data.sdss.org/sas/sdss5/sandbox/roboreassign/, which requires standard collaboration log in credentials to access.

For robo_reassign_fiber_allocation_maps.ipynb, only the .csv file from the "Final Status" column is needed.
